 Gradle

Gradle combines Maven’s dependency management with Ant’s flexibility, using a Groovy or Kotlin-based DSL.
It executes tasks, which can depend on each other.
Each build script (build.gradle) defines plugins, repositories, dependencies, and custom tasks.

Gradle supports incremental builds and build caching, making it much faster.

📁 Typical Gradle Project Structure
my-gradle-app/
 ├── build.gradle
 ├── settings.gradle
 ├── src/
 │   ├── main/java/com/example/App.java
 │   └── test/java/com/example/AppTest.java
 └── build/

⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Install Gradle
sudo apt install gradle
gradle -v

Step 2: Create a Simple Project
gradle init --type java-application

Step 3: build.gradle file

Step 4: Build and Run
gradle build     # compiles, tests, and packages
gradle run       # runs the app
gradle test      # runs tests

Gradle stores outputs in the build/ directory.

🧠 In CI/CD
In Jenkins or GCP Cloud Build:
Artifacts from build/libs/ are uploaded to Artifact Registry or deployed via Cloud Run / GKE.

Gradle is best for: modern projects, especially those using Kotlin, Android, or microservices that need faster, flexible builds.
