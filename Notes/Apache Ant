🧱 1️⃣ Apache Ant

Ant is a task-based build system.
You define targets (like "compile", "package", "deploy"), and each target executes a series of tasks (like javac, jar, copy).
It’s similar to writing a Makefile in XML.

Ant does not assume any project structure or lifecycle — you must explicitly tell it what to do and in what order.

📁 Typical Ant Project Structure
my-ant-app/
 ├── build.xml
 ├── src/
 │    └── com/example/HelloWorld.java
 ├── build/
 └── lib/

⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Install Ant
Step 2: Create build.xml
Step 3: Run Ant Commands
Step 4: Output

🧠 In CI/CD
In Jenkins or GCP Cloud Build:
The generated .jar file can be uploaded to Artifact Registry and deployed.

Ant is best used for: legacy Java projects or when you want full control over every build step.
